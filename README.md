# PATHFINDING AND MAZE GENERATION VISUALIZER

Graphical User Interface built using React Framework to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. Feel free to fork or download this project if you would like to try this out or use this code as the base to create your own Pathfinding Visualizer.

[Check out the visualizer in action here. Experiment with the pathfinding and maze generation algorithms.](https://graph-algorithms-visualizer.vercel.app/)

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Algorithm
3. Greedy Best First Search
4. Bidirectional Greedy Search
5. Breadth First Search
6. Depth First Search
7. Random Walk

## Maze Generation Algorithms:
1. Random Maze
2. Recursive Division Maze
3. Vertical Division Maze
4. Horizontal Division Maze

## Documentation of Various helper Functions used:
1. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Thank you

I hope you found the project useful and interesting.
