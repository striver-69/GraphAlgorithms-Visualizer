# PATHFINDING AND MAZE GENERATION VISUALIZER

Graphical User Interface built using React Framework to visualize Pathfinding Algorithms and Maze Generation Algorithms. Feel free to fork or download this project if you would like to try this out or use this code as the base to create your own Pathfinding Visualizer.

[Check out the visualizer in action here. Experiment with the pathfinding and maze generation algorithms.](https://graph-algorithms-visualizer.vercel.app/)

## Pathfinding Algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm -> Dijkstra's Algorithm is weighted and guarantees the shortest path!
2. A* Algorithm -> A* Search is weighted and guarantees the shortest path! 
3. Greedy Best First Search -> Greedy Best-first Search is weighted and does not guarantee the shortest path!
4. Bidirectional Greedy Search -> Bidirectional Greedy Best-first Search is weighted and does not guarantee the shortest path! and is fast as compared to Greedy Best First Search
5. Breadth First Search -> Breath-first Search is unweighted and guarantees the shortest path!
6. Depth First Search -> Depth-first Search is unweighted and does not guarantee the shortest path!
7. Random Walk -> Random walk is unwieghted and does not guarantee the shortest path! It can even get trapped in a maze.



## Maze Generation Algorithms:
1. Random Maze
2. Recursive Division Maze
3. Vertical Division Maze
4. Horizontal Division Maze

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).

## Thank you

I hope you found the project useful and interesting.
